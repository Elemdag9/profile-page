## 1. About the Project

This is a **mini-project** focused on building a clean, semantic, and modern "Profile Card" component. It serves as a foundational exercise in developing strong **starter frontend development skills**, particularly focusing on HTML structure and robust CSS class naming conventions (using a modified BEM-like approach).

The goal is to create a reusable, self-contained component that can be easily integrated into a larger portfolio or personal website.

## 2. Features

The current HTML structure provides the following core elements:

* **Semantic Structure:** Uses `<main>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and `<section>` tags for clear document outline.
* **Profile Area:** Dedicated space for a profile photo (`profile-card__placeholder`).
* **Personal Information:** Displays the developer's name (`Tirkish Meretdurdyyev`) and a brief description.
* **Statistics:** A dedicated list (`profile-card__stats`) to show key metrics (Projects, Experience, Followers).
* **Social Links:** A navigation section (`profile-card__social-media`) with links to external profiles (YouTube, Github, Linkedin).

## 3. Getting Started

Since this is a simple static HTML file, getting started is straightforward.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR-REPOSITORY-URL-HERE]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd profile-card-mini-project
    ```
3.  **Open the file:**
    Simply double-click on the `index.html` file, or open it in your browser:
    ```bash
    # (On most systems)
    open index.html
    ```
    The browser will render the basic HTML structure, ready for CSS styling.

## 4. Technology Stack

This project currently utilizes only the core web language:

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | Provides the semantic structure and content of the profile card. |
| **CSS3** (Planned) | Will be used to apply styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and responsiveness. |
| **JavaScript** (Planned) | Will be used for any future interactive features or dynamic data loading. |

## 5. Current Status & Roadmap

### Current Status

The project is currently at the **structural HTML stage**. All content is present, and classes are named, but no styling has been applied yet.

### Roadmap

Future plans for development include:

* ✅ **Phase 1: Complete CSS Styling**
    * Implement Flexbox/Grid for layout.
    * Define typography, colors, and shadows.
    * Ensure the component is fully **responsive**.
* ⏳ **Phase 2: Add Interactivity**
    * Implement a dark/light mode toggle.
    * Add hover effects to social links and stats.
* 🚀 **Phase 3: Refactoring and Clean-up**
    * Optimize HTML/CSS for production.
