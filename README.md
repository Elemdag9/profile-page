## 1. About the Project

This is a mini frontend project focused on building a clean, semantic, and modern **Profile Page / Profile Card**.

The project is intentionally developed in stages to strengthen core frontend fundamentals. It starts with fully semantic HTML, continues with structured and maintainable CSS, and will later be extended with JavaScript for interactivity.

The goal is not only visual output, but also learning proper structure, layout logic, and a realistic development workflow similar to real-world frontend projects.
